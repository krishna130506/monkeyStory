once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest there lived a crocodile with his wife...
one day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodil came back the next day for more fruitsas he loved them.
One day the crocodiles wife asked the crocodile to go get the monkeys heart but the crocodil refused so the crocodiles wife herself went to get the monkeys heart
